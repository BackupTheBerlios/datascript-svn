    <h2>About DataScript</h2>


      <p>There are dozens of languages for modelling abstract datatypes.
        For some of these, the binary representation of the defined types is
	implementation dependent and of no concern. Others do provide a binary
	encoding, but there is usually no way to retrofit an abstract
	specification to an existing binary format.</p>

      <p><a href="http://datascript.sourceforge.net">DataScript</a> is a formal 
        language for modelling
        binary datatypes, bitstreams or file formats. Using a formal language for 
        defining such binary datatypes resolves all ambiguities typically found 
        in textual or tabular specifications.
      </p>
      
      <p>In addition, one can automatically generate encoders and decoders for 
         a given binary format from such a formal specification, so that 
         application developers do not have to worry about serialization and 
         can focus on application logic instead.</p>

      

     <p>After evaluating different data modelling languages and toolsets,
    DataScript was selected by the authors as the most promising approach for
    formally defining a car navigation database format.</p>

    <h2>About the dstools Project</h2>


    <p>This project is a spin-off of the Physical Storage Format 
    Standardization Initiative (PSI), a joint effort of about 20 partner 
    companies in the automotive industry to standardize a car navigation 
    database format.</p> 

    <p>After evaluating different data modelling languages and toolsets, 
    including ASN.1, CSN.1, UML, XML Schema and others, DataScript was selected 
    by the PSI as the closest match to our requirements.</p>

    <p>While the initial DataScript <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=81815&amp;release_id=166537">reference implementation</a> 
    by Godmar Back provided a great 
    start, we found that some language extensions were desirable to better 
    support our specific requirements. For this reason, we branched off our 
    own project from Back's reference implementation.</p> 

    <p>As a major addition to the DataScript language, we introduced relational
    extensions, which permit the definition of hybrid data models, where the 
    high-level access structures are implemented by relational tables and 
    indices, whereas the bulk data are stored in single columns as BLOBs with 
    a format defined in DataScript, hence the name Relational DataScript or 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dstools">rds</a>. 
    rds is currently built on top of the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> 
    embedded database.</p>
